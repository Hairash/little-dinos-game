        <h3>Description</h3>
        <div class="text-block">
          It is a simple turn-based strategy game, where you can challenge the bots, play with friends, or even mix it
          up with both bots and pals.<br>
          <br>
          The gameplay unfolds on a randomly generated grid, punctuated by impassable rock cells. As the game begins,
          you'll have a tower and a dino of the same color (e.g.,
          <span style="color: #3e6eff;">blue for the first player</span>) staying on it. The dino
          displays its speed as a number in its bottom right corner, representing how many cells it can traverse in a
          single turn. Other dinos, whether they're friend or foe, are obstacles you can't move through as well as
          rocks.
          <br>
          <br>
          To move a dino, simply click or tap on it, then select the cell you want it to go to. When a dino completes
          its move, it eliminates opposing dinos in its immediate vicinity (those in the 4 main directions: ‚¨ÖÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è).
          If your dino lands on an enemy tower, it captures the tower and it becomes yours.

          Before you dive in, note that there are a few game settings available. Kindly recommend you to start with the
          "fog of war" option disabled and towers only to understand what's going on.
